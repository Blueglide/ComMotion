Simple test/demo for the ComMotion Motor Driver

The DAGU ComMotion motor driver packaged as a Arduno Shield is a full featured 4-port motor controller with many advanced features. However several users have reported that beyond basic motor control, certain advanced features are not fully implemented and are unlikely to be fixed in the future. (See notes in the top comment section of the ComMotion3.ino file for more information.)

When the Author's ComMotion shield was purchased, no simple Arduino based examples could be found to verify basic operation.  

To remedy that, the simple demonstration software in this repo is offered. It is about   the minmum required to start, stop, change direction or speed of one or more connected motors using an Arduino UNO microcontroller. The seven supporting functions in the ComMotion.h file were copied and used unchanged from examples found following links on the controller's <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/commotion-shield-omni-and-mecanum-wheel-robots">product page</a>

Good Luck with your project!
